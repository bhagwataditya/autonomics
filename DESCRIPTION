Description: 
  Many powerful platforms for molecular profiling have emerged in recent years: NGS, qPCR, MS, Microarrays, ...
  They all use different technologies and produce different raw files.
  These raw files are preprocessed, often resulting in an intermediate data file. 
  Format and arrangement of this intermediate data file differs between platforms.
  Yet, the backbone structure is identical, containing three rectangles of information: 
  (1) feature quantifications, (2) feature annotations, and (3) sample design.
  Building on this genericity, importomics provides a generic importer for any rectangular omics data file.
  The importer reads the data directly into a SummarizedExperiment. 
  Additionally, when sample names are chosen consistently, it also automatically extracts sample design from sample names. 
  This makes the imported SummarizedExperiment directly ready for subsequent statistical analysis.
  For a number of commonly used platforms (LCMS Proteomics/MaxQuant, RNAseq, SOMAscan, Metabolon), we additionally provide
  dedicated importers, based on the generic backend. These additional importers take care of additonal, platform-specific 
  taks required prior to analysis.
